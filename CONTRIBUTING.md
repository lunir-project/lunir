# Contribution Guide

Thank you for contributing! Please refer to the guidelines below before starting.

## Feature Requests

When considering a feature request, first look at our *[RFCs](/rfcs)*.

Make sure your feature request aligns with the RFC guidelines, and doesn't already exist, then create an RFC based on the *[template](/rfcs/TEMPLATE.md)*.

After creating your RFC, fork the repository and send a pull request, where it will then be reviewed.

If necessary, you may also make your own unit test, just make sure that it is comprehensive and covers all possible cases.
