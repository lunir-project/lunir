# RFCs (*Request for Comments*)

Welcome to the RFCs (Request for Comments) section, which provides ideas for new features, design updates, or significant improvements.

Before a change is implemented, a design document called an RFC explains its justification, design factors, and potential effects.

## How to contribute

First, make sure your feature request doesn't bring any significant breaking changes to the codebase and retains backwards compatibility.

Then, decide if your request belongs in one of the existing catergories listed below.

| Category     |
|--------------|
| [HIR](hir/)  |
| [MIR](mir/)  |
| [IL](il/)    |

If your RFC does not fit into any of the listed categories, create an issue requesting the addition of a new category.

Once you've found the correct category, click on it and make a copy of *[TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md)*.

Rename the new file to a descriptive title in snake_case, follow the template, then make a pull request with your RFC addition.

## Discussion

If you'd like to discuss the merits of a proposal, we encourage you to create a *[Github Discussions](/../../discussions)* topic.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank anyone that has taken the time to provide an RFC, or submit feedback on existing proposals.

Your feedback and insights are always helpful to us.
